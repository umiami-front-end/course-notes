## How to review your notes

Course notes are written in HTML (and CSS). This is to help you become familiar with the code you will be writing, in addition to learning the content contained within the notes themselves.

There are two ways you can review the notes:

1. As they are **formatted for the web**. You can open any file by dragging it to the Google Chrome icon on your dock. You can also open the files from within the browser by selecting "File", then "Open File" from the menu.

2. As **code**. Open the file by dragging it to the Atom icon on your dock. You can also open them from within Atom, by selecting "File", then "Open" from the menu. Having access to notes in this format gives you code to tinker with. The more code you see and play with, the more comfortable you should become.
