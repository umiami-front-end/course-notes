        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>a high-level, interpreted language</li>
          <li>the secret sauce of web interactivity</li>
          <li>introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0 (1995)</li>
          <li>commonly used in browsers for client-side scripts</li>
          <li>has gained popularity for server-side uses (i.e. node.js)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript is not Java!</h2>

        <p>JavaScript and Java are not the same. They have different syntaxes and uses.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is an interpreted language. Java is compiled.</p>

        <p><small>Please don't say we are learning Java ... this is a teeny pet peeve. >:}</small></p>

        <h2>Standard JavaScript</h2>

        <p><abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</title> (European Computer Manufacturers Association), through assistance from Netscape, developed a standard version of JavaScript in 1997.</p>

        <p>The standardized version is ECMAScript, but everyone still calls it JavaScript.</p>

        <p>The language is continually evolving. New features are added yearly.</p>

        <p>ECMAScript 6 (2015) is supported by 98 percent of current browsers. (See: <a href="kangax.github.io/compat-tabele/es6">ECMAScript compatibility table</a>)</p>

        <h2>Considerations</h2>

        <p>JavaScript is standardized and widely adopted, but some users:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>may turn off JavaScript functionality</li>
          <li>surf with older browsers which may lack ES5/6 support</li>
          <li>lack bandwidth to download large scripts, libraries</li>
          <li>lack computing power to handle client-side processing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript Console</h2>

        <p>Modern browsers include a command-line interface which lets us work step-by-step with JavaScript.</p>

        <p><strong>Chrome:</strong> View → Developer → JavaScript Console</p>

        <p><strong>Firefox:</strong> Tools → Web Developer → Web Console</p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2><abbr title="Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop">REPL</abbr></h2>

        <p>The JavaScript Console is the example of a REPL:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reads</strong> your command</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluates</strong> the statement or expression</li>
          <li><strong>Prints</strong> a result</li>
          <li><strong>Loops</strong> ... repeats the previous steps!</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Using the Console</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>tinker with very simple statements</li>
          <li>interact with window, document object models</li>
          <li>be alerted to errors when code is incorrect</li>
          <li>debugging</li>
          <li>isolate parts of a script loaded into the browser</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h2>Tips</h2>

        <p>If you are unsure about how an aspect of JavaScript works, try entering an example in the console.</p>

        <p>If the example requires multiple lines of code, type <code>shift-return</code> at the end of each line to keep the code from executing. The cursor will move to the next line so you can continue typing your command(s).</p>

        <h2>Testing Big Scripts</h2>

        <p>Sometimes it is easier to write code in a file than in the console. Include the script in a basic HTML page, then load the HTML page into the browser.</p>

        <p>Use this method when scripts become too cumbersome for the browser's REPL.</p>
